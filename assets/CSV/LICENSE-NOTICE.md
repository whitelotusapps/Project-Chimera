## Included Data: XANEW Word Ratings

This project includes and makes use of a subset of data derived from:

> Norms of valence, arousal, and dominance for 13,915 English lemmas.  
> *Behavior Research Methods*, 45, 1191–1207.

### How This Project Uses XANEW Data

This project uses a small portion of the XANEW dataset—specifically, the mean sums of **valence**, **arousal**, and **dominance** (columns: `V.Mean.Sum`, `A.Mean.Sum`, `D.Mean.Sum`)—to compute affective weights for words. The dataset itself is not modified, and the original data and licensing terms are preserved.

The inclusion of this dataset does **not** imply that the dataset is relicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. The dataset remains under its original CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license.
